Introduction and setting up:
===============================

Some issues with JavaScript: 
-------------------------------
var a;
undefined
a = 10;
10
a = "Hello"
"Hello"
a = {};
{}
function add(a,b) {return a+b;}
undefined
add(10,20)
30
add(10)
NaN
add(10,20,40)
30
var person = {"firstname":"Manju","lastname":"muni"};
undefined
person
{firstname: "Manju", lastname: "muni"}
person.firstname
"Manju"
person.age = 10;
10
person

Application complexity
	- code base gets on increasing
	- if 10 different team works - complexity increasses
	

With all this problems why do we need JavaScript ?
Ans: Because Web Browsers supports only JavaScript

Note:
you need to send code that to be run on browser then it should be only javascript.	

soluton is: use TypeScript language to develop and transpile (compile) it into javascript and then browser will run the javascript.
but we can technically transpile typescript code on browser itself but it is inefficient.

same thing happens to Node.js also - nodejs runtime can only understand javascript 	it doesn't understand typescript.
so you write application using typescript and run it thru the typescript compiler and you get javascript and you have javascript excuted in nodejs environment.

typescript = javascript + type

there is concept of Typing in TypeScript - this helps in type checking at compile time.

problem here is javascript is evolving continuously - 'let' keyword and arrow function etc... 
the problem is now since new feature added to javascript, we cant confidently provide those new feature because on latest version web browser it will work, 
but what about client who are still using old web browser, your code will break.

Now for this problem - TypeScript helps lot. you can still use latest features and convert the code into native javascript which is supported in old version of web browsers.

typescript consist of old javascript, which can be deployed to browser, called Ecma Standard 5 (ES 5).
typescript also contains new feature of ES6 and ES7
so ultimatley typescript will take care of conversion.

So, TypeScript
	- Makes building these complex apps more manageable
	- framework like Angular 2 (onwords) is using typescript. Even ReactJS community also uses.

	
Setting up TypeScript:
----------------------

1. editor of your choice - visual studio code is fine
2. NodeJS is required - 
	1. to transpile TypeScript code into JavaScript code. 
	2. To run the javascript which is converted - so nodeJS does two things for us.
3. To install the TypeScript Compiler - Typescript is like node module (or node package).  Use npm cmd to install typescript compiler. cmd is 'npm install <package-name>'

Install Visual Studio Code:
Head to code.visualstudio.com and install. 

Install NodeJS:
Go to nodejs.org and install node js.
To make sure node is installed use command 
/> node -v
V9.3.0

/> npm -v
5.5.1

Note: 
NPM is package manager for node. This comes with node installation.

>>npm install typescript 
this will install the typescript in the current working directory
but if you need it globally avialable use -g

>>npm install typescript -g

cmd output: after running 'npm install typescript'
-----------
C:\Users\manjunath
`-- typescript@3.4.3

npm WARN enoent ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Users\manjunath\package.json'
npm WARN manjunath No description
npm WARN manjunath No repository field.
npm WARN manjunath No README data
npm WARN manjunath No license field.

cmd output: after running 'npm install typescript -g'
------------------
C:\Users\manjunath\AppData\Roaming\npm\tsc -> C:\Users\manjunath\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\typescript\bin\tsc
C:\Users\manjunath\AppData\Roaming\npm\tsserver -> C:\Users\manjunath\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\typescript\bin\tsserver
C:\Users\manjunath\AppData\Roaming\npm
`-- typescript@3.4.3

Note:
on mac/linux: if there is permission issue. use 'sudo' in front of npm cmd.
